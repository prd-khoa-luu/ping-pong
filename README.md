# Simple Ping Pong
Built with Claude Sonnet via Github Copilot.

[AI generated]

This implementation includes:

* A monochromatic color scheme using black and white
* Simple mouse-controlled player paddle on the left
* AI-controlled opponent paddle on the right
* Score tracking
* Ball physics with angle calculations based on where the ball hits the paddle
* Gradually increasing difficulty as the ball speeds up after each hit
* Responsive paddle movements
* Clean, minimalist design

To play the game:

* Move your mouse up and down to control the left paddle
* Try to hit the ball past the AI-controlled paddle on the right
* First to score wins!
* The AI opponent uses a simple following algorithm that tracks the ball's vertical position, making it challenging but not unbeatable. The game gets progressively harder as the ball speeds up with each hit.
